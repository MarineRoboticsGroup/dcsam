   * For this solver, runs an iteration of alternating minimization between
   * discrete and continuous variables, adding any user-supplied factors (with
   * initial guess) first.
   *
   * 1. Adds new discrete factors (if any) as supplied by a user to the
   * discrete factor graph, then adds any discrete-continuous factors to the
   * discrete factor graph, appropriately initializing their continuous
   * variables to those from the last solve and any supplied by the initial
   * guess.
   *
   * 2. Update the solution for the discrete variables.
   *
   * 3. For all new discrete-continuous factors to be passed to the continuous
   * solver, update/set the latest discrete variables (prior to adding).
   *
   * 4. In one step: add new factors, new values, and earmarked old factor keys
   * to iSAM. Specifically, loop over DC factors already in iSAM, updating their
   * discrete information, then call isam_.update() with the (initialized) new
   * DC factors, any new continuous factors, and the initial guess to be
   * supplied.
   *
   * 5. Calculate the latest continuous variables from iSAM.
   *
   * 6. Update the discrete factors in the discrete factor graph dfg_ with the
   * latest information from the continuous solve.
   *
   * @param graph - a gtsam::NonlinearFactorGraph containing any
   * *continuous-only* factors to add.
   * @param dfg - a gtsam::DiscreteFactorGraph containing any *discrete-only*
   * factors to add.
   * @param dcfg - a DCFactorGraph containing any joint discrete-continuous
   * factors to add.
   * @param initialGuessContinuous - an initial guess for any new continuous 
   * keys that appear in the updated factors (or if one wants to force override
   * previously obtained continuous values).
   * @param initialGuessDiscrete - an initial guess for any new discrete keys
   * that appear in the updated factors (or if one wants to force override
   * previously obtained discrete values).
